# Software Benchmarking Script
A simple method for launching a process and collecting system resource utilisation statistics.

## Contents
`sbs.py` is used to execute a command and monitor system resources used by the opened process
`plotter.py` is used to plot the output data generated by `sbs.py`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your machine

```git clone https://github.com/jakeb1996/SBS```

2. Open your CLI and navigate to the root directory of the repository.

### sbs.py
3. To run the `sbs.py` script, use the following command:

```python sbs.py -c <command> -o <data-output-file> -s <polling-interval-secs> -l <tailable-y-n>```

Command arguments include:

`c` The command to run. eg: `notepad.exe`

`o` Filename for saving the data to eg: `output.csv`

`s` The polling interval for checking utilisation of system resources, in seconds. eg: `1`

`l` Toggle whether the data output file is tailable (y/n). eg: `y` ie: `tail -f output.csv.log`

### plotter.py
4. To run the `plotter.py` script, use the following command:

```python plotter.py -f <data-input-file> -t <tool-name-as-string>```

Command arguments include:

`f` The data input file (in CSV format) generated by `sbs.py` eg: `output.csv`

`t` The name of the tool analysed by `sbs.py` eg: `"Cas-OFFinder"`

Plots are configured within the Python script. See file for details.

## Output
### sbs.py
Two files are generated by `sbs.py`:
1. System resource utilisation CSV which includes a header row and:

	Time of recording

	Number of threads created by process

	CPU utilisation as percentage. Values over 100% indicate utilisation of multiple cores.

	Resident Set Size memory usage (physical memory usage)

	Virtual Memory Size (phy+vir memory)

	IO read count

	IO read bytes

	IO write count

	IO write bytes

	Number of child processes

2. A log file describing:

	Launch time

	Launch parameters

	Debug info (when appropriate)

	Clean-up process

### plotter.py
Associated PNG files are generated for each plot. Output files are placed in the same directory as the input file.

## Dependencies
SBS depends on the `psutil` library available via pip. 

`pip install psutil`
